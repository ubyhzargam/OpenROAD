# I have already peformed logic synthesis using YOSYS and generated timing reports using OPENSTA in my other 2 repositories after writing code in verilog. The flow is first comes verilog code which models a circuit. This is synthesised to netlist using YOSYS. To know more in detail view Yosys repo in my profile. After we have technology mapped netlist, we can generate timing reports using OpenSTA, to know in detail, head to OPENSTA repo in my profile. In this repo, the major focus is physical design using OpenROAD. We give tech mapped netlist generated by yosys as input, sdc constraints, lef library file and a tcl script which is already provided by the tool. Let us start doing physical design

# Design
The complete layout looks like this - <br>

Let us just view the layers, nets and routing <br>

These are the rows used to place the standard cells - <br>

As you can notice the majority area of the layout is unused. We can reduce the chip area according to our needs in the tcl script.<br>
This is the ground network - <br>
